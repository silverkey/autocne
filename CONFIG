#
# Very simple configuration file - Pay attention in what it needs:
#
# - The key on the left and the value on the rigth of the = symbol.
# - Comment lines start with # as usual........
# - Empty lines are not taken in consideration........
# - All the spaces are removed before to parse each line so DO NOT USE spaces inside the key/value.
# - Do not use " or ' or other strange symbols in the key/value they are not parsed and create problems.
